* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project? **20-30 hours**
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors? **Requested some video guidance on gerstner waves from the professor**
* Did you use any external resources? 
  * Note it is fair to utilize some tutorials--cite them here. You **must** add your own personal touch however!
