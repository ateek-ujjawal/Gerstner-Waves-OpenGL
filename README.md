Simulates gerstner waves in OpenGL. Includes different skyboxes for various effects. Also includes a refractive algorithm for ripple effects.
Use numbers 1-4 to control the intensity of the ripples. Use left and right arrows to cycle through different skyboxes.

Made as a part of my final project for Computer Graphics.
